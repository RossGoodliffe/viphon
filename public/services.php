                        <p>It is often difficult for media professionals to specify construction projects which need to be defined in
                            terms of Architecture, acoustics, power, and air conditioning. We understand both the media
                            production requirements and the construction process – we therefore act as a bridge between the
                            two. With hundreds of projects behind us, we also know the pitfalls and try gain enough information
                            from the client to ensure nothing is missed out of the specification.</p>
