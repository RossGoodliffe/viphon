            <div class="sp-title-info">
                <p>Leading broadcast technology and services company Timeline Television appointed our principal Ricard Goodliffe to oversee the development of a former data centre building in Ealing into a large-scale broadcast facility.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sp-title-info">
                <p>The building had many attractive features other than its location in West London and close to major transport links. It also had a deep basement which would house studios 1 and 2, high performance back-up generators on the roof and A+B UPS systems for technical power pre-installed. </p>

            <div class="sp-main-info">
                <p>Working closely with Timelineâ€™s CEO, Daniel McDonnell, the development developed the basement and the six upper floors, with only light refurbishment to the ground floor reception to increase security to the building. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="sp-main-info">
                <p>There were some substantial challenges including, moving the large scale technical power installation to form a large open space for studio 2 and installing a cargo lift to provide set and furniture access to the basement studios.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sp-main-info">
                <p>The works were undertaken over 10 stages, lasting 3 years, with the first deadline being a range of galleries, edit suites, studio 1 and associated facilities for the Whisper Films / Channel 4 remote coverage of the 2020 Paralympic games.
